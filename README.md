# 8-Wordle
Learning how to make Wordle from scratch... it is very janky...
I've tested this many times and attempted to fixed the jankiness of it when you start over (restart the game)...
My vs-code will show it as "5 guesses left" even though, there are 6 guesses.
Then it says "5 guesses left" again, finish the game, start over, it'll repeat "4 guesses left" twice...
...
This is why my list of words are like that...

Edited:
I was testing this in "6 guesses" total, I changed it to 5 so it goes along with the 5 theme thing.
